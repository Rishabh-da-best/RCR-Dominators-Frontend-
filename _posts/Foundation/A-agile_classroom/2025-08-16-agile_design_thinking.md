## Integrating Agile and LxD

In this article, we compare multiple approaches to learning and development. While many models and frameworks exist, our emphasis will be on three complementary perspectives:

**Adapted Agile** – an iterative, feedback-driven process that guides how learning solutions are planned, built, and refined.

**Design Thinking Process** – a human-centered, creative problem-solving process that ensures solutions meet learner needs.

**Merrill’s Principles of Instruction** – a problem-centered, modular instructional design framework that ensures learning is effective, efficient, and engaging.

These three perspectives form the foundation of the discussion that follows, shaping how we integrate Learning Experience Design (LxD) with Agile methodologies in education.

## Adapted Agile

Agile development and educational design share a common challenge: effective assessment and improvement require intentional planning and feedback.

- In software, Test Driven Development (TDD) ensures that testing is built into the development cycle.
- In education, Backwards Design emphasizes starting with assessment goals before planning instruction.
- Design Thinking brings these ideas together by centering the user—whether that’s a learner or a software customer—through empathy and defining a clear point of view (POV).

This approach ensures each sprint becomes more than a sequence of tasks—it’s a continuous loop of improvement driven by user needs and team reflection.

### SPRINT CYCLE (2–4 Weeks)

1. **Sprint Backlog**  
   List all tasks, requirements, and ideas for the sprint. This ensures learners have a clear roadmap and aligns with LxD principles of structured iterative work.

2. **Sprint Plan**  
   Decide what the team can realistically achieve in this cycle. Planning builds prioritization skills and connects learning objectives to tangible outcomes.

3. **Meet-users ↔ Meet-owners ↔ Empathy → Vision and Requirements**  
   Gather input from stakeholders and potential users to understand their needs. Empathy strengthens design relevance and helps define clear learning goals.

4. **Perspective ↔ POV → User-stories**  
   Translate observations into points-of-view and actionable user stories. This connects research insights with concrete tasks, fostering learner-centered design.

5. **Sprint Development**  
   Begin building or prototyping based on the backlog. Active creation reinforces understanding and encourages experimentation.

6. **Ideate ↔ HMW → Issues**  
   Brainstorm solutions framed as “How Might We” questions. This encourages creative problem solving and the generation of multiple learning pathways.

7. **Standup → Pinup → Kanban**  
   Conduct short check-ins and visualize progress on Kanban boards. This supports self-management, collaboration, and transparency of work.

8. **Implementation → Code**  
   Turn prototypes or designs into working solutions. Hands-on implementation aligns with Agile Development and LxD emphasis on learning by doing and iterative refinement.

9. **Test ↔ Using User-stories → Feedback, Issue Checks**  
   Validate outputs against user stories and requirements. Iterative testing encourages reflection, feedback incorporation, and improvement.

10. **Burndown ↔ Using Issues → Issue Done?**  
    Track completion visually with burndown charts. This fosters awareness of progress and helps learners manage tasks dynamically.

11. **Retrospective ↔ Using Vision → Revise Vision and Requirements?**  
    Reflect on successes, challenges, and evolving requirements. Retrospectives cultivate meta-cognition and adaptive design thinking.

12. **Sprint Close**  
    Finalize deliverables and lessons learned. Closing reinforces accountability and prepares the team for the next iteration, ensuring continuous improvement.

## Incorporating Design Thinking (Section 1)

**Instructional Design vs. Learning Experience Design** a comparison.

**Instructional Design** is the traditional approach to creating learning opportunities. It focuses on identifying needs, setting goals, defining assessments, and establishing learning objectives using established frameworks and tools.

**Learning Experience Design (LxD)** evolves this thinking by emphasizing flexibility and responsiveness to the diverse needs, interests, and goals of learners. LxD aims for equitable outcomes and integrates elements from User Experience Design (UxD), graphics, games, and overall learner experience. The shift from Instructional Design to LxD is fueled by new technologies, mobile learning, iterative development, and the growing emphasis on early feedback.

### Human-centered Design

Human-centered design puts the learner at the center of the solution. Content is developed from the learner’s perspective, with the goal of building solutions that are truly adapted to the audience.

The process is cyclical and includes:

- **Inspiration:** Understanding the learner’s context and needs.
- **Idea:** Generating creative solutions.
- **Implementation:** Bringing ideas to life in practical ways.
- **Iteration:** Continuously refining solutions based on feedback.

---

### Learning Experience Design

LxD is about designing learning that adapts to individual needs, interests, and goals, striving for equitable outcomes for all learners.

It incorporates principles from user experience, game design, and graphic design to create engaging and effective learning environments.

The key differences between Instructional Design and LxD are rooted in a more iterative, feedback-driven philosophy, and a focus on mobile and flexible learning.

### Instructional Design Process Models

**ADDIE Model:** The most well-known instructional design process, consisting of:

- **Analyze:** Define goals, audience, and resources.
- **Design:** Align instructional strategies to goals.
- **Develop:** Create learning resources and pilot test.
- **Implement:** Integrate resources into the learning environment and engage users.
- **Evaluate:** Assess the effectiveness of instruction and resources.

**SAM (Successive Approximation Model):** Focuses on iterative phases and tasks:

- **Preparation:** Background research and information gathering.
- **Iterative Design:** Design, prototype, and review.
- **Iterative Development:** Develop, implement, and evaluate (Alpha, Beta, Silver, Gold stages). SAM aims to make ADDIE more agile, though it still includes some pre-planned milestones.

- **Understanding by Design (UbD):** A Backwards Design approach:

  - 🎯 Identify desired results.
  -  Determine assessment evidence.
  - 🛠️ Plan learning experiences and instruction.

### Design Thinking Process

Design Thinking is a flexible, human-centered process that sits at the heart of LxD.

In a classroom, it can be challenging to simulate authentic user feedback, but you can get creative—try “cross-table” exchanges, connect with another CS class during office hours, host an informal meet-up (even at a Panera 😊), or share your ideas with friends or family.

The key is to make feedback social—learning from different perspectives strengthens your design. The five phases can be adapted for classwork:

- **Empathy:** Use quick interviews, observations, or “focus swaps” across tables to uncover how peers think and feel. Try creating mini-surveys or role-play scenarios to simulate real users.
- **Define:** Turn your findings into a clear problem statement and Point-of-View (POV). Frame it in the form of a User Story (e.g., “As a student who struggles with tool installation, I need basic Linux knowledge so that I can work in the terminal.”)
- **Ideate:** Run rapid brainstorming sessions—sticky notes, whiteboards, or digital tools. Encourage “How Might We” (HMW) questions to spark creativity and push beyond obvious solutions (e.g., “How might we write code that makes installation easier?”).
- **Prototype:** Build quick, low-fidelity versions of your ideas—sketches, flowcharts, mockups. Start lo-fi, then increase fidelity (e.g., diagrams → clickable prototypes → code). Use class reviews as checkpoints for feedback.
- **Test:** Treat presentations, peer reviews, and teacher feedback as testing sessions. Rotate roles so different students lead at the keyboard—this spreads responsibility and gives everyone a turn at navigating the “user experience.” You might also reverse the roles and put the teacher at the keyboard while students provide instruction. Finally, don’t be afraid to take your work outside of class—show friends, family, or even the folks at Panera 😊 what you’ve accomplished.

## Examining Various Approaches to Learning (Section 2)

### Instructional Approaches to Learning

- 🏆 **Behaviorist:** Learners respond to stimuli, and instructors obtain responses. This approach is especially valuable for young learners, where rewards (like gold stars) motivate learning.
- 🧠 **Cognitivist:** Focuses on memorization, organization, repetition, and well-defined problems as a foundation for deeper learning. Learners develop metacognition and adapt previous learning to new contexts. Learning is highly individual.
- 🛠️ **Constructivist:** Authentic learning is achieved by solving or creating real-world solutions. Group formation is key, and deep learning comes from producing tangible results. Learners have more control over their experience, such as choosing projects, compared to scripted learning outputs.
- 🔗 **Connectivist:** Leverages information systems, groups, and cultures with large quantities of information. Learners connect to systems and people to facilitate learning, often using the internet and AI. This approach builds on constructivist principles, with learners actively building knowledge through authentic choices and projects.

### Mastery Learning Approaches

- ✅ **Mastery Learning:** Learners must demonstrate mastery of a concept, skill, or procedure before moving on. In large classrooms, this is challenging, but learning analytics and adaptive technologies help personalize instruction and measure student success.
- ⏰ **Traditional Learning:** Progression is dictated by a predefined schedule, moving to the next skill based on time rather than mastery.
- 🏎️ **Competency-Based Education (CBE):** Learners move at their own pace with immediate formative feedback. CBE formalizes mastery learning, with frequent student-teacher interactions to measure success.
